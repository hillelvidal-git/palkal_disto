tps doisconnections:

///////// this function determine if tps is connected or not:

BL.checkTpsConnection { 
    Double gap = (DateTime.Now - tpsLastHeard).TotalMilliseconds;
    bool alive = gap <= TpsAliveMaxIntervalMs; //this criteria is 8.5 seconds
    }


///////// and what set tpsLastHeard? tpsAlive function

BL.tpsAlive() { tpsLastHeard = DateTime.Now; }


//////// and what calls tpsAlive function? 5 functions:

1. when measure point complete
2. when set-prism complete
3. when pointing at target complete
4. when check-tilt complete
5. when get-battery completet
--- this two last functions happens in KeepAlive function

//////////// ok. what calls KeepAlaive? the loop functoin of TpsAdapter thread:

if (swKeepAlive.ElapsedMilliseconds > KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL_MS) //every 2.5 seconds
   {
   swKeepAlive.Reset(); 
   swKeepAlive.Start();
   KeepAlive();
   }

>>>>>>> Possible Bus: before calling to KeepAlive, tpsAdapter sends all commands to tps, sleeping 250ms after each.
Maybe it sometimes blocks KeepAlive from running for a significant time.
Possible solution: Add KeepAlive call after each command
